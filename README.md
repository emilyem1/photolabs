# react-photolabs
PhotoLabs is a full-stack web application developed during Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp. This project served as an entry point into the realm of React, utilizing a basic application skeleton to craft a functional app, with a primary focus on mastering state management.

# Photolabs
PhotoLabs is fueled by NodeJs, ExpressJs, PostGreSQL, and ReactJs. It's meant to simulate a photo-sharing platform where users can favourite photos, explore detailed views upon clicking, and browse photos by topic.
